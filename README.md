# Carte Diem — PCB

This directory contains the **custom ESP32-S3-based PCB** designed for the Carte Diem smart shopping cart system.  
The board serves as the central embedded controller, interfacing with all on-cart sensors, peripherals, and the Raspberry Pi.

---

## Overview

The PCB is responsible for:
- Real-time sensor acquisition
- Item verification and cart state monitoring
- Power distribution and regulation
- BLE communication with the Raspberry Pi

It was designed to support **all-day operation**, modular peripherals, and reliable performance in a noisy retail environment.

## Key Features

- **ESP32-S3 MCU**
  - Runs FreeRTOS
  - Handles sensing, control, and BLE communication

- **Peripheral Interfaces**
  - UART: barcode scanner, item RFID, cart-tracking RFID
  - SPI: payment RFID module
  - I²C: IMU, proximity sensor
  - GPIO + ADC: load cells (via HX711)

- **Power Architecture**
  - 12 V input (external battery)
  - On-board buck and LDO regulation
  - Supports 12 V, 9 V, 5 V, 3.3 V, and 1.8 V rails

- **Connectivity**
  - BLE for bidirectional communication with Raspberry Pi
  - Dedicated connectors for modular sensor attachment

## Design Notes

- EMI mitigation was required due to proximity of RFID modules and load cells  
- Power paths were designed conservatively to support peak current draw  
- The board went through multiple revisions to resolve rail shorting and voltage tolerance issues
